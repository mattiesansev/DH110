# DH150 Assignment 02: Pilot Usability Testing by Mattie Sanseverino

## Introduction 
LessonFace is a website that connects prospective students to knowledgeable instructors in various fields. The website connects students to freelance instructors, and has a variety of options for music education. Users can search for an instrument and a list of instructors and their backgrounds becomes available. Users can then browse instructors, their reviews, and book sessions. 

This project aims to create an accessible website for a target audience of middle aged men without music experience who would like to learn how to play an instrument. The challenge is to create a space where the audience can choose which instrument to learn, easily find the best methods to learn and book appointments with instructors that they trust. The contextual analysis interview allowed me to get more information from my target audience, and figure out which methods work best for them. I aimed to find their goals, desires and struggles when it comes to learning a new hobby, and the best ways that they would approach learning to play an instrument. 


## Script
The contextual inquiry script can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11F2OUT5EITq8F2tgI21ssvQnP9s29XVappWOQoe3QtI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Interview Media
The interview was performed via Zoom and was recorded. The recording allows for me to transcribe the user's responses, and also view how they approached the activities. The activities I asked the user to do were to search for and find multiple websites that they think could help them learn music. Then, the users were instructed to navigate through the website and find what they believe to be "step 1" of the learning process. The user was also instructed to talk through their feelings about the websites and rank them based on how they felt the websites were able to serve their needs.

## Observation Notes

## Reflection
I felt that the interview went well, but it was shorter than I expected. Next time, I would include more activities. Next time I would also plan to have a series of interviews with the same person. I would track the person's progress through their learning; starting by finding a couple suitable websites, setting up meetings with instructors, and trying out a few weeks of lessons. Following the user through their whole learning process would allow me to understand better the struggles that they have, and their needs in a website. I also learned that it is always a good idea to practice the script beforehand, but that it's okay if little things go wrong, as long as the user is comfortable. 

It was a bit awkward to perform the interview, but I believe the warmup questions really helped get me and the interviewee more comfortable and open to talking. I also think that I did a good job asking follow up questions or clarifying questions that weren't on my script, but I added in when I felt that the follow up would be useful for my analysis. Having the user go through different websites was frustrating, since I didn't have control over what they clicked on, but it was very revealing. It taught me a lot about how my target audience approaches website-finding and navigating. Overall, I think that the interview went well and was very revealing.
