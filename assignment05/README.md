# Assignment 5: Persona and Usage Scenario

## Background
This project aims to create an accessible website for a target audience of middle aged men without music experience who would like to learn how to play an instrument. The challenge is to create a space where the audience can choose which instrument to learn, easily find the best methods to learn and book appointments with instructors that they trust. The contextual analysis interview allowed me to get more information from my target audience, and figure out which methods work best for them. I aimed to find their goals, desires and struggles when it comes to learning a new hobby, and the best ways that they would approach learning to play an instrument.

After a few weeks of research, this low fidelity prototype allows me to test the functionality of the features I want to implement, and give an outside user the chance to walk through it. 

## Tasks
The low fidelity prototype will implement the following tasks:

1. User can select from a grid of options to see different results -- group classes, one on one classes, or seminars.
2. On the results page, user can select from different filters -- by level, instrument, instructor details, again, by class size.
3. From the main screen, user can access a quiz that matches them to a level, and instrument type. The quiz also teaches the user about different instruments as they go through.
4. On the profile dashboard page, the user can set and see their personal goals as well as compliments from their instructor(s).

This wireframe represents the welcome page with different options. Experienced and/or knowledgeable users can use the search bar to search for instruments. Less experienced users can select from the quiz, or they can choose which type of lessons they're looking for. This feature is an improvement for middle-aged users because they may not know where to start.

This wireframe shows the filter options on the results page. These filter options allow the results to be less overwhelming and more aligned with the user's desires.

This wireframe shows what the quiz page functionality might look like. The quiz connects lost users with a relevant results page.

This wireframe shows what the Achievements page on the profile dashboard might look like. The achievements page allows users to feel accomplished as they complete their lessons.

## Conclusions
Creating the wireflow really forced me to think deeply about my interface. I had to think about all of the scenarios and the directions that the user may want to go. Through testing it with someone and by myself I was able to see that I need a clear way to 'exit' and 'go back' in every state. Additionally, I need to avoid states that are simply going in circles. The simpler the process, the better for the user. If I were to do the prototype again, I would take more time to focus on two tasks instead of combining multiple tasks. I would focus more and have more realistic options that way it makes more sense to the person testing it out. Right now, it's unclear in some spots what they should do because I have dummy values in as placeholders. Based on the testing, I am going to change my design by adding more clear ways to go backwards, and adding "info" popup buttons to explain what things mean (like what a guitar vs bass is, how to tell if you are beginner or intermediate, etc.).
