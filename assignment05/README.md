# Assignment 5: Persona and Usage Scenario

## Background
This project aims to create an accessible website for a target audience of middle aged men without music experience who would like to learn how to play an instrument. The challenge is to create a space where the audience can choose which instrument to learn, easily find the best methods to learn and book appointments with instructors that they trust. The contextual analysis interview allowed me to get more information from my target audience, and figure out which methods work best for them. I aimed to find their goals, desires and struggles when it comes to learning a new hobby, and the best ways that they would approach learning to play an instrument.

After weeks of research, this low fidelity prototype allows me to test the functionality of the features I want to implement, and give an outside user the chance to walk through it. 

## Tasks
The low fidelity prototype will implement the following tasks:

- User can select from a grid of options to see different results -- group classes, one on one classes, or seminars.
- On the results page, user can select from different filters -- by level, instrument, instructor details, again, by class size.
- From the main screen, user can access a quiz that matches them to a level, and instrument type. The quiz also teaches the user about different instruments as they go through.

This wireframe represents the welcome page with different options. Experienced and/or knowledeable users can use the search bar to search for instruments. Less experienced users can select from the quiz, or they can choose which type of lessons they're looking for. This feature is an improvement for middle-aged users because they may not know where to start.
