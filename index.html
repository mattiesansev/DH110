      <h1 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">Introduction</h1>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">The goal for DH 110 Spring 2022 was to work with a website or app that targets music learning for middle aged men. I found a website to work off of called LessonFace. LessonFace is a website that connects prospective students to knowledgeable instructors in various fields, and has a variety of options for music education. Users can search for an instrument and a list of instructors and their backgrounds becomes available. Users can then browse instructors, their reviews, and book sessions.</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">My project aims to create an accessible website for a target audience of middle aged men without music experience who would like to learn how to play an instrument. The challenge is to create a space where the audience can choose which instrument to learn, easily find the best methods to learn and book appointments with instructors that they trust. Middle aged men tend to want a simple and relaxing environment for a new hobby and way to be creative. <b>Learning an instrument can be very difficult and discouraging, so it's important to have a website where a student can find an accessible instructor and track their progress. This project is important because it connects a demographic of people who can be burnt out and uninspired to a new, creative stress reliever.</b></p>
      
      
      <h1 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">Competitor Analysis</h1>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">
        First, I evaluated existing products that aim towards connecting students to lessons or instructors for music education. I found LessonFace and Learn the Harmonica.</p> 
      <h2 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
          <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">During the early stages of this project, I performed a heuristic evaluation on these two websites. These website fell short in accessibility and clarity. Overall, LessonFace is not appropriately setup for a middle aged man to use to learn to play an instrument for the first time. It gives users too many options, and assumes they know the specifics of different types of instruments. Although the website is functional and has a plethora of resources, it comes off as overwhelming and thus difficult to navigate. Learn the Harmonica also is not equipped for middle aged men. However, it is better equipped than LessonFace since there are fewer and less overwhelming options. The clear tabs and distinct categories of videos make it easy for the user to see what to do. So, some classes can be easily accessed without any experience. However, the website isn't well set up for a long-term music learning. The categories get more confusing as the user gets more specific, and progress can't easily be tracked without purchasing a subscription. Additionally, the website itself is overly simple and not as technologically advanced as it could be -- for example, it could have a search bar and be responsive.</p>

      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">The full heuristic evaluations can be found <a href="https://github.com/mattiesansev/DH110/tree/main/assignment01">here.</a> </p>
      
      <h2 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">Usability Testing</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">
      I performed a usability test in order to get an outside user's perspective of the website. I noticed several usability issues during my initial heuristic analysis, and I must validate the severity of the issues as well as confirm that I didn't miss any more issues. The purpose of the usability testing is to find out the best way to improve the website based on the user's current experience: their likes and dislikes about the site's flow, efficiency, setup, etc.

I tested three of the main heuristic issues that I noticed in my personal heuristic analysis.</p>
    <li style="padding-left: 60px;">Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
    <li style="padding-left: 60px;">Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
    <li style="padding-left: 60px;">Help and documentation</li>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px; padding-top: 20px">The full usability testing can be found <a href="https://github.com/mattiesansev/DH110/tree/main/assignment02">here.</a></p>
      
  
      <h1 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">User Research</h1>
      <img width="779" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-05 at 2 32 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/161853263-f7e20b9e-d40f-41ee-a122-92e24c654348.png">
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">In the user research phase, I performed a contextual inquiry interview with someone within the target audience. The contextual analysis interview allowed me to get more information from my target audience, and figure out which methods work best for them. I aimed to find their goals, desires and struggles when it comes to learning a new hobby, and the best ways that they would approach learning to play an instrument. I found that they were able to navigate through the websites well, but weren't able to find exactly what they wanted such as an instructor who specializes in teaching experts. </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-top: 20px">The entire contextual inquiry and links to the interview can be found <a href="https://github.com/mattiesansev/DH110/tree/main/assignment03">here.</a></p>
            <h1 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">UX Storytelling</h1>
      <img width="779" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-05 at 2 32 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/161853263-f7e20b9e-d40f-41ee-a122-92e24c654348.png">
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">UX storytelling allows designers and researchers to think about the user's perspective and create features based on that. Creating different personas reveals different features that users need, and the designers are able to better think through what the user's thought process and journey will look like if they have a whole profile on them. For this assignment, I created two personas and two features based on them. The target audience is middle-aged men, which is nearly the opposite of what I am, so creating a made-up user to work off of is very helpful to think through what features I need.</p>
      <h2 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">Persona 1: Pierre Perez, the stressed mid-life crisis.</h2>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">Pierre represents the user group who is exhausted when they get home from work, and wants a relaxing activity and new hobby. View his persona below.</p>

                  <h1 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">Low-Fidelity Prototype</h1>
      <img width="779" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-05 at 2 32 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/161853263-f7e20b9e-d40f-41ee-a122-92e24c654348.png">
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">After a few weeks of research, creating a low fidelity prototype allowed me to test the functionality of the features I wanted to implement, and give an outside user the chance to walk through it.</p>
      <h2 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">Tasks</h2>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">I implemented the following tasks in my low fidelity prototype that I found in my research to be most important.</p>
      <li style="padding-left: 60px;">User can select from a grid of options to see different results -- group classes, one on one classes, or seminars.</li>
    <li style="padding-left: 60px;">On the results page, user can select from different filters -- by level, instrument, instructor details, again, by class size.</li>
    <li style="padding-left: 60px;">From the main screen, user can access a quiz that matches them to a level, and instrument type. The quiz also teaches the user about different instruments as they go through.</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 60px;">On the profile dashboard page, the user can set and see their personal goals as well as compliments from their instructor(s).</li>
      <h2 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">Example Wireflows</h2>
      <img width="779" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-05 at 2 32 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/166822936-5e4cf583-8d7a-4d49-9dde-b686c700e561.png">
      <img width="779" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-05 at 2 32 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/166822982-acc52947-a6bd-4274-b4ff-6bb2d40a441a.png">
      
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">During the process of creating wireflows, I learned that I need a clear way to 'exit' and 'go back' in every state. Additionally, I need to avoid states that are simply going in circles. The simpler the process, the better for the user. Creating a simple and understandable wireflow will lead to a better final product overall because if a user can't understand how to navigate without graphics and distractions, it's unlikely they will be able to figure it out with the extra styles.</p>
      
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-top: 20px">The full wireflows and analysis can be found <a href="https://github.com/mattiesansev/DH110/tree/main/assignment05">here.</a></p>
      
      
      
      
      <h1 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">Interface Design</h1>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">Interface Design testing allows for designers to test out different variations of how the project should look visually. The designer makes different variations for different properties (typography, colors, shapes, etc.) and iteratively chooses which design is best. Having different versions of the interface also allow for the designer to take in feedback from potential users as they go, so informed design choices can be made. Interface design testing is also important for measuring accessibility. Once colors and shapes are added to a prototype, it is essential to check that the site is easily readable by all groups.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">I made versions of my Profile Dashboard page with the following variations:</p>
      <li style="padding-left: 60px;">Typography</li>
    <li style="padding-left: 60px;">Shape</li>
    <li style="padding-left: 60px;">Color</li>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">A few graphic design variations are shown below.</p>
      <img width="779" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-05 at 2 32 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/167910452-d17916a8-73b4-4a2d-b941-94b6a869d8e7.png">

      <h1 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">High-Fidelity Prototype</h1>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">The high-fidelity interactive prototype stage is important, but can't come without all the stages mentioned before. Based on feedback to the wireflows, low-fidelity prototype and interface design, a high-fidelity prototype is made with fully functional flow and approved graphic design. This prototype allows users to test functions within the application and find errors. Cognitive walkthrough testing give the designer the chance to observe how easily a user completes required tasks within the website so they can make changes to the design and flow as needed.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">My high-fidelity prototype implemented the following tasks:</p>
      <li style="padding-left: 60px;">Easily view the profile dashboard to see your accomplishments. Add more goals and view motivational notes from your instructors.</li>
    <li style="padding-left: 60px;">Use the search bar or a selection from the grid of class type options on the home page to see a list of instructors that match your search. Use the filters on the results page to personalize the search for things like instrument type, class type, instructor rating, etc.</li>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">The updated wireflow with interactive capabilities can be seen below.</p>
      <img width="779" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-05 at 2 32 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/170323847-edf6d3a8-28c1-48b7-b2ef-95180539fac0.png">

      <h1 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">Pitch Video</h1>
      <iframe style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;" width="560" height="355" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zuhSG9BRTT4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      
      <h1 style="color:darkgreen; padding: 20px">Conclusion</h1>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">Going through the entire design process taught me a lot. I learned that everything must be done while thinking about the user's perspective. This means that there are many steps along the way that require testing and feedback from an outside perspective. This was very challenging for me because the user would find issues in places that I didn't expect. Overall, it was great to work with users and find the best way to create an effective site for music learning. I am proud of the way the project turned out and I am excited to use my new skills in other areas such as making flyers and invitations.</p>
           <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">If I had more time to work on the project, I would have created more variations and talked to more users. Also, as a future software engineer, I would have loved to work more technically on the project after I finished the prototype. It was great to learn how to use Figma since I will be implementing designs in Figma for my job. If I had more time I would have loved to start to code the website.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">Overall, this process was very rewarding and I am grateful for the clear instruction and consistent timeline of assignments and due-dates! Thank you professor Cho for guiding me through this project.</p>
