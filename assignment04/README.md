# Assignment 4: Persona and Usage Scenario

## Introduction
UX storytelling allows designers and researchers to think about the user's perspective and create features based on that. Creating different personas reveals different features that users need, and the designers are able to better think through what the user's thought process and journey will look like if they have a whole profile on them. For this assignment, I created two personas and two features based on them. The target audience is middle-aged men, which is nearly the opposite of what I am, so creating a made-up user to work off of is very helpful to think through what features I need.

#### Scenario and Journey Map

WHY:
Matthew wants to have something creative to do after work. He has always wanted to learn how to play the guitar, but he has no experience with music. He knows that he can't teach himself how to play, and he struggles with online resources such as sheet music and YouTube videos. 

HOW:
He searches online for private guitar lessons, and finds LessonFace. He doesn't know much about music, so he clicks on the first button available to him: the search bar, and searches "guitar." The results page has a filter option "beginner" that he selects. From here, he finds an instructor.

PROPOSED FEATURE: "beginner" filter (along with other levels).

### Scenario and Journey Map
WHY:
Pierre is always exhausted when he gets home from work. He lives alone and just moved to a new city. He wants something fun and social he can do from the comfort of his own home. He decides that he wants to learn how to play an instrument so he can eventually meet up with people and play. He doesn't have much instrument experience, so he finds LessonFace. He is looking for group beginner courses.

HOW:
From the options on the home page, Pierre clicks on "group lessons" and then filters "beginner" on the results page. From here, he can scroll through the available online group courses beginning at different times, and select one.

PROPOSED FEATURE: set of simple options on the home page, "group courses" being one of them.
