# DH150 Assignment 02: Pilot Usability Testing by Mattie Sanseverino

## Introduction 
LessonFace is a website that connects prospective students to knowledgeable instructors in various fields. The website connects students to freelance instructurs, and has a variety of options for music education. Users can search for an instrument and a list of instructors and their backgruonds becomes available. Users can then browse instructors, their reviews, and book sessions. 

## Rationale 
I performed a usability test in order to get an outside user's perspective of the website. I noticed several usability issues during my initial heuristic analysis, and I must validate the severity of the issues as well as confirm that I didn't miss any more issues. The purpose of the usability testing is to find out the best way to improve the website based on the user's current experience: their likes and dislikes about the site's flow, efficiency, setup, etc. 

I tested three of the main heuristic issues that I noticed in my peronsl heuristic analysis.

Heuristic Being Tested | Usability Problem  | Task Scenario  |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Flexibility and efficiency of use |  There are a variety of options for instruments, languages, arts, group classes, articles, features, etc., but not many filters for instructor specifications.  | Find an instructor withh >5,000 lessons taught  | 
Aesthetic and minimalist design  | There are too many different ways to search for instruments, and too much going on on the main page.  | Search for 4 different instruments 2 different ways.  |
Help and documentation  | The FAQ page is difficult to find with a smaller screen size and it is not well-organized.  | Find out how to become an instructor on the FAQ page.  |

## Setting
The usability test was performed via Zoom, in a portable minimalistic lab setting. Both myself and the participant had access to a personal laptop computer that was running Zoom, the LessonFace website and the survey.

The test described below was a **pilot test,** meaning that the test was performed mainly in order to test thhe setting and materials.

## Process
During the Zoom call, I read aloud the script from the survey, and walked the participant through the questions and scenarios in the survey. I started off with **Consent form** that ensures the particpant is willing to participate in the test and be recorded. Then, I moved onto **background questions** about their prior experience with the website. The participant did not have prior experience with the site. The **pre-test questionnaire** next measured the particpant's initial reactions to the website. After the pre-test, we moved onto the **tasks and scenarios** where I presented 3 different tasks for the particpant. The particpant completed the tasks with minimal issues. Then, the **post-test questionnaire** measured the particpants overall evaluation after completing the tasks. After that, the recording is turned off and the **demographics** section is completed. General demographic data is anonymous.

## Reflection
During the pilot test, I learned that it can be nerve-wracking to lead a test like this. Overall, I think that the test went well. The test took around 20 minutes, and the user made it through all the scenarios. They seemed to understand the descriptions and, after the test, told me that my instructions were very clear. The transitions were smooth as well. But, I definitely need to refine my scenarios. In order to save time and preserve the particpant's anonymity, I had the participant stop the process before making an account, which prevented some functionality from being tested. I learned that next time, I should add a question to the consent form noting that the user will be required to make an account for the scenario testing, but the recording can be paused as they input their email and password. Another way I could improve the test would be to rehearse the script more and add more specific descriptions about the site. Also, I want to add more to the scenarios so more of my known usability issues are tested. I need to add more open-ended tasks so the user can show me which of the 3+ ways to find instruments is most intuitive.
