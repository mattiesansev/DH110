# Introduction
This project aims to create an accessible website for a target audience of middle aged men without music experience who would like to learn how to play an instrument. The challenge is to create a space where the audience can choose which instrument to learn, easily find the best methods to learn and book appointments with instructors that they trust. The contextual analysis interview allowed me to get more information from my target audience, and figure out which methods work best for them. I aimed to find their goals, desires and struggles when it comes to learning a new hobby, and the best ways that they would approach learning to play an instrument.

Interface Design testing allows for designers to test out different variations of how the project should look visually. The designer makes different variations for different properties (typography, colors, shapes, etc.) and iteratively chooses which design is best. Having different versions of the interface also allow for the designer to take in feedback from potential users as they go, so informed design choices can be made. 

The digitized wireflow can be found [here](https://whimsical.com/wireframes-UGJCx84rRQLfGJkHRZzRwx). The wireflow that I selected to implement was the "Achievements" page.

## Impression Test

### Conclusions from test

## Accessibility Check
I performed color contrast checks on the typography colors over the different backgrounds. At first, not all of my combinations passed the test. I then returned to Adobe Color and experimented with different colors until I passed the accessibility checks.
