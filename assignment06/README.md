# Introduction
This project aims to create an accessible website for a target audience of middle aged men without music experience who would like to learn how to play an instrument. The challenge is to create a space where the audience can choose which instrument to learn, easily find the best methods to learn and book appointments with instructors that they trust. The contextual analysis interview allowed me to get more information from my target audience, and figure out which methods work best for them. I aimed to find their goals, desires and struggles when it comes to learning a new hobby, and the best ways that they would approach learning to play an instrument.

Interface Design testing allows for designers to test out different variations of how the project should look visually. The designer makes different variations for different properties (typography, colors, shapes, etc.) and iteratively chooses which design is best. Having different versions of the interface also allow for the designer to take in feedback from potential users as they go, so informed design choices can be made. 

The digitized wireflow can be found [here](https://whimsical.com/wireframes-UGJCx84rRQLfGJkHRZzRwx). The wireflow that I selected to implement was the "Achievements" page. 

# Interface Design Testing

## Layout Test

I created rows and columns and a padding on the edges in order to make sure that my elements followed grouping techniques and were properly spaced. 

## Typography Variations
<img width="486" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-11 at 10 26 36 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/167910302-b75a90de-3c95-4b75-bce4-d8519ceaaa46.png">
First, I started by trying a new font that I believed could look nice: "Font Awesome 5 Brands."

<img width="487" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-11 at 10 26 49 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/167910323-e1763c86-b9bd-4ba1-8971-4bdc6b6656cb.png">
Then, I thought that the bigger numbers and important headings should be bolded, so I added weight to them. I also changed the font to something more subtle: "IBM Plex Sans."

<img width="481" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-11 at 10 27 01 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/167910357-00f58d0c-6001-41b9-9d9b-03bdc27bd1fb.png">
Then, I made the headings even bigger and removed the bold style from the profile information, because I felt it was distracting. This version was used for the next set of variations.

## Shape Variations
<img width="480" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-11 at 10 27 30 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/167910452-d17916a8-73b4-4a2d-b941-94b6a869d8e7.png">
First, I changed the profile photo back to a square, and kept all the shapes sharp squares.

<img width="486" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-11 at 10 27 40 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/167910481-cc6b6f81-aeed-4b18-aa11-fb78da482e6e.png">
Then, I gave all the rectangular shapes a size 40 arc. This makes the page feel softer and more inviting. This version was used for the next set of variations.

<img width="482" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-11 at 10 27 53 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/167910517-6a31614d-05c3-4770-a801-cf34609d35f5.png">
Then, I tried to smaller arc, 30, and added ovals around the headers. The ovals were distracting and unnecessary since the large bolded text already draws enough attention to the headers.

## Color Variations
<img width="485" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-11 at 10 28 10 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/167910564-4e4cfb7e-a687-45bf-9790-4cbe149f674e.png">
First, I tried to sue a background color based off of what Adobe Color provided me to go along with the logo color. The heading and numbers text is a darker green that was also provided by Adobe. This text doesn't pass the accessibility checks, and there are too many shades. 

<img width="479" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-11 at 10 28 20 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/167910599-ae1c9630-54df-44e9-a19d-86f5b7e4123b.png">
So, I tried a lighter shade for the background color, and darker heading color. This design does pass the accessibility check, and draws the user's eyes to the headings, which clearly indicate what is happening below them. It also makes it clear that the "search" button is a button, since it is a distinct green. 

<img width="485" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-11 at 10 28 32 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19422176/167910629-4e034307-afa6-4a0d-bd7f-b479cbbe1e59.png">
I used Adobe Color recommendations to create a dark-mode version of my design. The dark purple and green compliment each other, and the white text stands out as well. This version also passes the contrast accessibility test. 

## Conclusions
My decision-making process is mostly described throughout the section above. Additionally, I made decisions based on what people around me said. I live with 3 other people so it was easy for me to ask someone what they thought about the color scheme, font, or layout. I worked off of this feedback and also off of the principles we learned in class. When deciding which version to go off of, I would take a step back and try to put myself in the user's shoes. I asked myself questions like 'would I know what to do on this page?' and created changes like making the button stand out more based on my response. Tools like the grid system and the accessibility check also helped me make my decisions.

## Accessibility Check
I performed color contrast checks on the typography colors over the different backgrounds. At first, not all of my combinations passed the test. I then returned to Adobe Color and experimented with different colors until I passed the accessibility checks.

## Impression Test
The evidence of the five-second impressions test can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10HyLLIR48fIKKJJ8MCT9krMMkPav-tus/view?usp=sharing).

### Summary of Impression Test
I performed a five-second impression test on someone who hadn't seen the design before, or even heard of my project before. I let her look at the final design for 5 seconds and then I asked her what she remembered and what her impression was. From just a short amount of time, she was able to understand that the page was a goal-tracking profile page for a user of a music learning website. This was a great description of the page, but some big details were missing. It should have been more clear **who** the page was for, in my example case, "Nick Vargas." Because the user didn't mention the name of the person, I created a final version with the name bigger.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, making this interface design was a learning experience. At first, I thought that making so many different versions would be overkill, but now I think that I could make many more versions and keep making the design better. I also learned that it's very useful to use tools. I could not have picked the colors myself, so Adobe Color was very useful. The Stark tool was also very useful because it caught errors that I didn't realize with the color combinations. Overall, making an interface design is much more difficult that I expected, and I learned a lot while doing it.
