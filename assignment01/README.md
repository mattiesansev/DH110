## Project description
During my past four years at UCLA, I've realized that I learn best when I learn from an instructor. I have loved taking classes to learn skills that I wouldn't have ever expected -- kickboxing, hip hop dancing, and even rock climbing. UCLA provides a centralized space and facilities to learn new skills, and I wonder how people outside of college approach learning new things. This thought brought me to want to work with websites for musical instrument education as a mid-life crisis -- a time in ones life where one is likely itching to learn something new. 

I specifically looked for one site that connected people with classes or instructors, because I know that is how I learn best, and when I think of my father and other middle-aged men in my life, I know that they would rather learn something from a person than a non-interactive environment. I also looked for a website that allowed the user to go through it at their own pace. Although this is less interactive, I imagined that a well-put-together self-paced website would work well into a (most likely) working middle-aged man. I came across two different websites, LessonFace and LearnTheHarmonica.
