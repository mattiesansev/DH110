## Project description
During my past four years at UCLA, I've realized that I learn best when I learn from an instructor. I have loved taking classes to learn skills that I wouldn't have ever expected -- kickboxing, hip hop dancing, and even rock climbing. UCLA provides a centralized space and facilities to learn new skills, and I wonder how people outside of college approach learning new things. This thought brought me to want to work with websites for musical instrument education as a mid-life crisis -- a time in ones life where one is likely itching to learn something new. 

I specifically looked for one site that connected people with classes or instructors, because I know that is how I learn best, and when I think of my father and other middle-aged men in my life, I know that they would rather learn something from a person than a non-interactive environment. I also looked for a website that allowed the user to go through it at their own pace. Although this is less interactive, I imagined that a well-put-together self-paced website would work well into a (most likely) working middle-aged man. I came across two different websites, LessonFace and LearnTheHarmonica.

### Background Information
LessonFace is a website that connects prospective students to knowledgeable instructors in various fields. The website connects students to freelance instructurs, and has a variety of options for music education. Users can search for an instrument and a list of instructors and their backgruonds becomes available. Users can then browse instructors, their reviews, and book sessions.

### Heuristic Evaluation
| Heuristic & Description | Evaluation | Recommendation for "Bad" Element(s) | Severity of "Bad" Element(s) |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **1\. Visibility of system status**<br>The website informs users about its current status in a clear way.                                                                            | **Successes**: The webiste has a clear popup in red that shows when the user inputs the incorrect password. The website also takes the user to a separate page upon a successful login -- the dashboard. Without logging in, the dashboard is not visible. Additionally, invalid URL extensions (like https://www.lessonface.com/fake-url) lead to a page that says the URL cannot be found. <br>**Failures**: From the dashboard, it is unclear howt o return back to the main page. When the user clicks "book a private lesson" the page leads to a different looking version of the instructor feed than you would see without logging in. This may be confusing to users. | Rather than sending the user to the dashboard after logging in, send them to the regular search page after showing a nootification that the login was successful and the dashboard in now available.                                                                 | 1                         |
| **2\. Match between system and the real world**<br>The language and features on the website are consistent with the user's knowledge of the real world. The user can intuitively undersatnd the language and flow. | **Successes**: The website uses simply language and includes pictures for reference for instruments. The site also separates categories logically, like by separating music from arts and language.<br>**Failures**: There are so many specific options for the user to choose from right away, and the middle aged man audience is unlikely to know the difference between options like "bass guitar," "blues guitar" and "reggae guitar." | Separate broader instruments into categories, and then include informational pages on the different versions of that instrument (bass vs blues guitar, for example).                                                                                      | 3 |
| **3\. User control and freedom**<br>The website should allow users to "escape" from unwanted processes.                                                                             | **Successes**: When booking a lesson, a popup comes up with more steps to go through, and there is a clear X in the top right corner that allows the user to stop booking the lesson. Also, after clicking "next" on booking a lesson, it is added to the shopping cart. Lessons are easily removed from the shopping cart by clicking the red "remove" button.<br>**Failures**: After selecting a category of instrument that the user is interested in, it is confusing how to search for a different instrument. The user must press the back button on the browser itself or click "categories" at the top left, and select a new one. The "categories" tab is confusing because categories have an X on them, but pressing the X doesn't remove them from the list. Instead, the usermust select a new category and the oold one simply disapears. | Fix the "Categories" tab so the X button gets rid of categories, and rename it to "cateogy" if only one is to be searched at a time.  | 2        |
| **4\. Consistency and standards**<br>The website is consistent with other similar websites. | **Successes**: The site has standard menu options, a dashboard, a intuitive search bar, and a shopping cart, all of which are consistent with similar websites. Also, the title image "Lesson Face" at the top brings the user back to the main page when clicked, which is a common feature.<br>**Failures**: The main page is cluttered, and may be confusing for middle aged men who don't know exactly what they're looking for. Normally, a shopping website will have a clean front page that allows for simple options that way the user doesn't get overwhelmed. | Create a simple starting page that doesn't have as many options, and doesn't display all possible categories.  | 2  |
| **5\. Error prevention**<br>The website avoids errors and checks user interactions to make sure no error states are entered.  | **Successes**: The website has a clear password-checking system and will create a clear error when an incorrect password is inputted. Also, the website shows suggestions as the user types into the search bar, so spelling mistakes can be better avoided.<br>**Failures**: When a category is incorrectly spelled, the website won't complete the search. Instead the user has to start over. This may be confusing for middle aged users because they may not know how exactly to spell what they're looking for, or get frustrated when they type something all the way out and they can't complete a search. | Create a more techncially advanced search system that can account for spelling mistakes. | 1  |
| **6\. Recognition rather than recall**<br>The features on the website are easy to follow and the user can navigate through the site by visually understanding what the flow is, without having to memorize it. | **Successes**: There are a variety of options on the home page, and the user can easily navigate back to the instrument they are interested in by searching or clicking on the icon below if they closed the page after performing a search.<br>**Failures**: After logging it, the user cannot see their previous searches. | Create a "previous searches" tab on the Dashboard after logging in. | 2 |
| **7\. Flexibility and efficiency of use**<br>The website is quick and easy to use for all ranges of users. | **Successes**: The website's search bar is intuitive for all users, and for users looking for something more specific, they are able to simply search for it. For new users who are unsure of the options, they are able to scroll down further and browse the optins.<br>**Failures**: The further the user scrolls down, the more confused they may get. There are a variety of options for instruments, languages, arts, group classes, articles, features, etc. and a novice user may get confused on which options to choose. | Create a page where the user can browse through options, and take a quiz to see what kind of classes they should be browsing. | 3 |
| **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design**<br>The website emphasizes the essentials and only contains what is necessary. | **Successes**: The "goals" page in the profile is simple and allows users to view and mark progress through their goals.<br>**Failures**: As mentioned above, the home page is cluttered and has too many options. Additionally, there are too many pages in general. The navigation menus and profile menus all have separate pages and unneccessary information. For example, the "Media" page is unneccessary since users can also send media to instructors through the message page.| Remove everything below the search bar in the landing page, and add an option to browse available services. The separate page allows users to explore different instruments and sessions availalbe, and even take a quiz to see what kind of course they want. | 3 |
| **9\. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**<br>When an error occurs, the website creates a clear way for users to understand and fix what is happening.  | **Successes**: If the user provides an incorrect password or username, there is a clear popup that says the issue. There is also a clear "Forgot Password" button that the user can click.<br>**Failures**: The website does not specify that an account with a specific email doesn't exist if it doesn't, and it doesn't say whether the username or the password is incorrect. | In the invalid login credentials popup, include information about what the issue is. |
| **10\. Help and documentation**<br>The website has information to help the user understand the purpose and answer questions. | **Successes**: The website has a "Frequently Asked Questions" page that is updated. <br>**Failures**: The "Contact" page is hidden in the footer of the website. When the page is shrunk smaller, the "FAQ" button disapears and is unable to be clicked. | Include the FAQ and Contact page in the main navigation menu. | 3 |
