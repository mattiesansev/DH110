# Interactive Prototype

## Introduction
This project aims to create an accessible website for a target audience of middle aged men without music experience who would like to learn how to play an instrument. The challenge is to create a space where the audience can choose which instrument to learn, easily find the best methods to learn and book appointments with instructors that they trust. The interactive prototype is an essential part in UX designing. It allows the designer to work with all the feedback they have received and create an interactive version of the wireflow. Cognitive walkthrough testing and other forms of user testing are essential at the interactive prototype stage, because they can mess around with the flow and the designer can get live feedback on the flow of the tasks.

## Tasks
The interactive prototype supports the following tasks:
1. Easily view the profile dashboard to see your accomplishments. Add more goals and view motivational notes from your instructors.
2. Use the search bar or a selection from the grid of class type options on the home page to see a list of instructors that match your search. Use the filters on the results page to personalize the search for things like instrument type, class type, instructor rating, etc.

## Wireflow

## Cognitive Walkthrough
During class on May 18, I performed a cognitive walkthrough with 2 other students. The evidence can be found through the following screenshot of the notes that my classmates left for me:

The process went smoothly, where I followed the script provided to me and asked many questions to my partners while they walked through my prototype. I took notes on their comments, and referenced them later when I made changes to my prototype. From the past few weeks, it's been really exciting to see my prototype come together. Every little comment and edit made a difference.

From this walkthrough I learned that my flow needs to be very clear, and the website won't make a lot of sense without most essential buttons being implemented. My reviewers helped me find ways to make my pages and flow make more sense. For example, they suggested that I add dividers between my preview comments from instructors. The original version looked like this:

And I updated the screen to look like this:

I also learned to be more consistent in my styling. For example, my reviewers suggested that I add black outlines on the result page since I have the curved black outlines on every other page. My results page now looks like this with the black outlines:

I was given more feedback, and would continue to implement it with more time. I learned a lot from the cognitive walkthrough process. At times, my reviewers didn't agree on suggestions and I learned that it's impossible to please everyone. I also learned that it's hard to see mistakes myself, as it was much faster for a fresh set of eyes to find my mistakes. Also, by looking through the other projects, I learned about new ways to make a clean flow, and I also learned ways in which a user can get confused. I got stuck in one of my partner's flows and learned that I needed more clear ways to get back to the home page for my project.
